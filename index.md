The End of Crypto Patents
===

Overview
--

Cryptographers have long noticed a large and growing gap between the latest research developments and what is used in practice. The reasons for this growing gap are many. One of them -- the systematic patenting of new crypto algorithms and methods -- is, in my opinion, insufficiently highlighted. Before we can truly consider the replacement of a major cryptographic building block -- RSA --, we must consider addressing this problem.

Crypto is always Essential
--

Cryptographic algorithms are most useful in use cases that require interoperaiblity between systems, e.g. one party encrypts or signs, another party, using different software, decrypts or verifies. Because cryptography mediates communication, it is typically only useful when it becomes part of a standard, formal or ad-hoc. Thus, new cryptographic algorithms are only interesting if they can play a part in these standards, in other words in cases where they become "essential."

Crypto is systematically patented
--

Since the advent of RSA, crypto algorithms have, for the most part, been patented. This makes implementing these crypto algorithms either particuarly onerous or particularly risky. In the case of open-source software, patented algorithms are almost certainly not usable.
